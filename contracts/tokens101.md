# Tokens 101: Understanding ERC-20

Tokens are the **heart of the EVM ecosystem**. Almost everything onchain (payments, governance, liquidity, even memes) is built on top of tokens. For developers coming from web2, you can think of tokens as the native data type of value: they represent balances tracked by a smart contract rather than by a centralized database.

ERC-20 is the **standard interface** that defines how these tokens behave. Every wallet, DEX, and DeFi app expects ERC-20 compatibility, it’s what makes tokens interoperable across the entire onchain world.

In this guide, we’ll unpack how ERC-20 tokens work, explore how transfers and approvals function under the hood, and explain how tokenomics (the “rules of the game”) are encoded directly into smart contracts.

## What ERC-20 defines

The [ERC-20 spec](https://ethereum.org/sw/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) describes a minimal set of functions that every fungible token must implement. These functions let contracts and wallets interact with tokens in a predictable way.

Here are the six required functions:

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
```

And the three optional metadata helpers:

```solidity
function name() external view returns (string memory);
function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
```

Every ERC-20 token you’ve heard of implements this same interface. The difference lies in _how the logic inside those functions is written_.

## Units and decimals

Tokens operate using **atomic units**, the smallest indivisible pieces of value onchain. For TIA and most ERC-20 tokens, this means **18 decimal places**. One whole token equals `1e18` atomic units. This system allows precise accounting, even for fractional amounts.

For example:

```solidity
uint256 amount = 0.5 * 1e18; // half a token in atomic units
```

Your wallet handles conversions automatically, but within the smart contract, everything happens in these scaled units. Understanding this prevents confusion when reading or debugging contract code.

## Events and observability

Events are the primary way that **onchain systems communicate with the offchain world**. When something happens inside a smart contract (like a transfer, an approval, or a state change) it emits an event that external systems can listen to.

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
```

These events don’t alter contract storage; they’re lightweight logs recorded on the blockchain. [Indexers](/tooling/indexers/overview), explorers, and [wallets](/tooling/wallets) watch for them to track token movements and update user interfaces.

## Reactivity and external triggers

Smart contracts on EVM-based chains are reactive, not proactive. They can’t autonomously perform actions on a timer or respond to changes unless someone (a user, bot, or keeper) calls one of their functions. Every state change happens as a result of an external transaction.

For instance, a contract can’t natively say “run this every 24 hours.” Instead, it can enforce time-based logic only when invoked:

```solidity
if (block.timestamp > lastAction + 1 days) {
    performAction();
}
```

This structure ensures determinism and security (nodes simply execute transactions in order) but it also means that automation must come from outside. Offchain actors monitor events, detect when a condition is met, and then trigger the corresponding onchain function call.

## Accounts, balances, and allowances

Every ERC-20 contract maintains two main mappings:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;
```

`balanceOf` tracks how many tokens each address owns. `allowance` tracks how many tokens one address (the _owner_) has approved another (the _spender_) to transfer on their behalf.

Together, these mappings form the token’s internal ledger. The contract updates them when tokens are minted, burned, or transferred. Your wallet simply reads these values to show your token balance.

This mental model (balances and allowances stored in the contract) sets up the foundation for understanding how token transfers actually work.

## How token transfers actually work

For developers new to blockchains, it’s tempting to think that sending a token works like sending digital cash. You might imagine that your tokens live _inside_ your wallet and are sent across the network when you hit “transfer.” But that’s not what actually happens.

Tokens live **inside a smart contract**, not inside your wallet. The ERC-20 contract keeps a public ledger of who owns what by mapping addresses to balances. Your wallet doesn’t hold tokens directly, it simply knows how to **read** your balance from that contract and how to **sign** transactions that tell the contract to update it.

When you transfer tokens to another address, what really happens is that you submit a transaction to the token’s smart contract, instructing it to move tokens from one address to another within that ledger.

```solidity
myToken.transfer(0xRecipient, 100 * 1e18);
```

Here, your wallet signs a message that says, “update the balance mapping: subtract 100 from me, add 100 to the recipient.” The contract then verifies your signature and updates its internal record.

Things work a bit differently when interacting with **other smart contracts** (like [vaults](/tooling/vaults/overview) or DEXes). A smart contract can’t initiate its own transfe, it can only move tokens that you’ve explicitly approved it to access. That’s why ERC-20 includes the **approve → transferFrom** pattern:

```solidity
// You approve another contract to use some of your tokens
myToken.approve(spenderContract, 1000 * 1e18);

// Later, that contract moves the tokens on your behalf
myToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), 1000 * 1e18);
```

This two-step design keeps control in your hands. The contract can only transfer the amount you’ve approved, never more. However, it also introduces security risks if used carelessly:

- Approving unlimited allowances can expose your tokens if the spender contract or its keys are compromised.
- Poorly written contracts can misuse approvals, leading to drained balances.

In practice, most apps and wallets handle this flow automatically: you click “approve,” the wallet signs the transaction, and the smart contract gains limited access. But it’s important to understand what’s really happening under the hood: **the tokens never leave the contract that defines them; only the ownership record inside that contract changes.**

## Tokenomics: rules as code

What people call _tokenomics_ is simply **custom logic coded into the token contract**. The ERC-20 interface defines the shape (total supply, balances, transfers) but the _math_ and _rules_ are up to you.

For example:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    totalSupply += amount;
    balanceOf[to] += amount;
}
```

That’s a basic mint. But you could extend it with inflation, burn rates, or transfer taxes, all implemented as code:

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    require(to != address(0), "zero address");

    // Optional: apply a small inflation multiplier
    // Example: +1% inflation on each mint
    uint256 inflation = (amount * 100) / 10_000; // 100 = 1.00%
    amount += inflation;

    // Optional: burn a small portion at mint (deflationary mechanic)
    // Example: 0.5% burn
    uint256 burnAmount = (amount * 50) / 10_000; // 50 = 0.50%
    amount -= burnAmount;

    // Optional: transfer tax or treasury fee
    // Example: 1% goes to treasury
    uint256 fee = (amount * 100) / 10_000;
    amount -= fee;
    _balances[treasury] += fee;

    // Finally, mint the remaining tokens to the user
    _balances[to] += amount;
    totalSupply += amount + fee; // include the treasury portion
    emit Transfer(address(0), to, amount);
    emit Transfer(address(0), treasury, fee);
}

```

This is how every token’s economy works: whether it’s deflationary, inflationary, or yield-generating, it’s just Solidity code shaping who holds what and when.

## Summary

ERC-20s are the backbone of onchain finance. They define a universal language for fungible value (balances, transfers, and allowances) that every wallet and DEX understands. Once you grasp their mechanics, you unlock how nearly every DeFi, game, or onchain app works under the hood.
